# Tenzin's Linux Personalizations

Customization stuff I like in linux environments. Saved here.

## `zsh` Setup

Install `zsh` if not on the machine (really should be on most standard boxes these days).

Run `zsh ./zsh_setup.sh` to install zsh extensions.

Install `fzf` (on Mac `brew` is a good option).
